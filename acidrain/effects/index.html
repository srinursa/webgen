    <h1 class="mainheading">Effects of Acid Rain</h1>
    <p>There are a variety of negative consequences of acid rain, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrodes buildings made of limestone</li>
      <p>Since limestone is basic and acid rain is acidic, acid rain reacts with the limestone and wears it away, corroding the buildings.</p>
      <li>Makes soil infertile</li>
      <p>Acid rain decreases the pH of the soil a lot, making it too acidic, which makes it infertile and impossible for plants to grow in.</p>
      <li>Kills underwater life</li>
      <p>Acid rain contaminates rivers, lakes, and streams, bringing down their pH, making them acidic. Fish and other creatures that live in the water can't survive under acidic conditions, so they die out.</p>
      <li>Kills plants and trees</li>
      <p>Acid rain kills plants and trees by making the area around them infertile, so they can no longer get the nutrients they need from the soil around them, and therefore die out. Also, most plants' and trees' primary source of water is rainwater, and most can not use acid rain as a source of water since it is too acidic, so they are also deprived of their water supply.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>The cost for acid rain damage reparations is estimated to be around $5 billion each year in the US and Canada, around £400 million each year in the UK, and around ¥110 Billion (about £12.8 billion) each year in China.</p>
    <p>In order to reduce the amount of acid rain, and therefore the amount of money being spent on reparations after it, emissions of gas such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide need to slow down or preferably stop. This can be done by switching to renewable energy sources, using clean or hybrid cars, carpooling, taking public transport, and placing stricter restrictions on the amount of pollution released by factories, to name a few.</p>
