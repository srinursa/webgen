    <h1 class="mainheading">Causes of Acid Rain</h1>
    <p>Acid rain can be caused by water vapour dissolving with one of a variety of different oxides, such as SO<sub>2</sub> (Sulfuric Dioxide) and N<sub>2</sub>O (Nitrogen Dioxide).</p>
    <p>These gases are emitted from various sources such as factories, cars, and power plants.</p>
    <h3>Sulfur Dioxide</h3>
    <p>Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to produce sulfurous acid, which reacts with oxygen to produce sulfuric acid, which is a form of acid rain. This is represented by the word equations below:</p>
    <p>Sulfur dioxide + Water &rarr; Sulfurous Acid<br>
    Sulfurous Acid + Oxygen &rarr; Sulfuric Acid</p>

    <p>Represented as chemical equations, these reactions are:</p>
    <p>SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (aq)<br>
    H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (aq) + &frac12;O<sub>2</sub> (g) &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq)</p>
    <p>Sulfuric acid usually lowers the pH of rain to below 5.0.</p>

    <h3>Nitrogen Dioxide</h3>
    <p>Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to produce nitric acid and nitrous acid, of which nitric acid is a component of acid rain. This is represented by the word equation below:</p>
    <p>Nitrogen dioxide + Water &rarr; Nitric acid + Nitrous Acid</p>
    <p>Represented as a chemical equation, this reaction is:</p>
    <p>2NO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; HNO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + HNO<sub>3</sub> (aq)</p>
